# Thursday Keynote Address

## Joe Cheng - Shiny in production

  - production - sofware environments that are used and relied on by real users, with real consequences if things go wrong
  - prod environment - includes server, connect, and databases
  - best practives includes a staging system that is identical to your procudtion environment
  - production goals:
      * keep it up
      * keep it safe
      * keep it correct
      * keep it snappy
      
  - can shiny be used in production?
    * 2015 - yes it is possible
    * 2019 - yes it is easy
    
  - challenges for shiny in production
    * cultural challenges:
        - shiny apps are developed by R users who arent software engineers
        - dont know best practices for deployment to production
        
    * organizational challenges:
        - IT and management are skeptical
        - IT skew towards conservative
        - Skeptical of data scientists creating production artifacts
        - skeptical of technolofies they haven't heard of
        - Engineering department may not be on your side
    
    * Technical challenges
        - shiny makes developing apps easier but doesn't address automated testing, load testing, profiling, and deployment
        - R can be slow and is single threaded
        
  - New tools for shiny in production
    * RStudio Connect
    * shinytest (R package)
    * shinyloadtest (R package)
    * profvis - profiler for R
    * Plot caching - Dramatically speed up repeated plots
    * Async - last resort for dealing with slow operations
    
    
* Performance workflow
  1. Use shinyloadtest to see if its fast enough
  2. If not, use profvis to see whats making it slow
  3. Optimize
    i. Move work out of shiny (very often)
    ii. Make code faster (very often)
    iii. Use caching (sometimes)
    iv. use async (occasionally)
  4. Repeat!
  
* shinyloadtest - generates large amounts of realistic traffic to your app, then analyze latency
  1. Run of deploy your app
  2. Record an archetypal user session using shinyloadtest
  3. Playback the recording with your desired level of concurrency
  4. Analyze the data
  
  
* Doing work ahead of time
  - If preformance matters, avoid loading raw data in shiny, instead preprocess the data into a form shiny can read fast
  - feather is a much faster method for reading data than csv
  
  * Plot caching
       A app is a good candidate for plot caching if:
        1. the app has plot outputs that are time consuming to generate
        2. These plots are a significant fraction of the total amount of time the app spends thinking
        3. Most user are likely to request the same few plots 
      - use `renderCachedPlot` instead of `renderPlot` using the option `cacheKeyExpr`
